# QMSAN-Project
This repository contains the implementation of the Quantum Mixed-State Attention Network (QMSAN) — a hybrid quantum–classical architecture designed for multilingual text classification.
The work integrates XLM-RoBERTa with quantum-inspired attention mechanisms based on mixed quantum states, enabling richer multilingual representations and improved cross-lingual generalization.
